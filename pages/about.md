# About Me
I am known as samr *or* samrcode.
I am from Canada, and I like coding recreationally.

I'm not the best at coding as I started a few months ago.
But, I'd say I'm good for just a few months.

I know many different languages.
Although, I only know a bit in most of the languages I know.

A few more than a few languages I think I'm good at:
- C#
- C++
- Julia
- D
- Lua
