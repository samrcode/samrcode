    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <a href="../">Back</a>
    <p>I am known as samr, samrcode, or by my name, Samar.</p>
    <p>I am some random person from Canada that likes coding recreationally.</p>
    <p>I'm not the best at coding, as I started a few months ago. But, I'd say I'm good for just a few months. I know many different languages.</p>
    <p>Though, I only know a bit in most of the languages I know.</p>
    <p>A few more than a few languages I think I'm good at: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>C#</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Julia</li>
      <li>D</li>
      <li>Lua</li>
      <li>Swift</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Go</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, I will fix this website one day.</p>
