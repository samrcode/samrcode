### Hello there!
Welcome to the samr GitHub profile.
I can do some coding. I know HTML, and I made a small program using VBScript called samrClicker, which is available on my profile repository.
You can always contact using my email, samar.thind@outlook.com. Which reminds me, I should probably go and clean up that inbox.
