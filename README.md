### Hello there!
Welcome to samr's GitHub.
I am known as samr, samrcode, or by my name, Samar.

#### About Me
I am from Canada, and I just like coding recreationally.
Most of the stuff I make isn't really meant to be mostly useful in any way.
I'm not the best at coding, as I really just started a few months ago. But, I'd say I'm good for just a few months.

I know many different languages.
Though, I only know a bit in most of the languages I know.
I'd personally only say I'm good at (in my view) C#, C++, Lua, Swift, Python, and D. Maybe also Julia.
