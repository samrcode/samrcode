    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <a href="../">Back</a>
    <p>Some random person from Canada that really likes coding recreationaly. I'm not the best at coding, as I really just started a few months ago. But, I'd say I'm good for just a few months. I know many different languages.</p>
    <p>Also, I will fix this website one day.</p>
